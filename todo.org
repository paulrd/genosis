* Genosis
** Package
  - run: npx vite build to get into a single optimized folder
  - use html-inline-assets tool on dist/index.html.
** Deploy
  - Use github actions, I save the action yaml script as action.yaml.
  - deploy single html page
** Use Hot Module Reloading
  - I have a custom vite plugin that does this.
  - defonce for the genosdb state.
** Replace Counter app weth GenosDB app
  Once I have the deployment pipeline working, try a basic genosDB app. I save
  the new html file as index2.html. The new cljs file that works with this is
  main2.cljs.
** package.json
  - needs to launch both watcher and vite with one command
  - maybe even the repl as well.
  - replaced:
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run watch\" \"npm run serve\""
    "serve": "vite",
** Questions to Ask Gemini
  - Why do I need to tell vite about cljs files instead of js files. My watch
    cljs seemed to be working just fine.
  - How do I run html-inline-assets on the result? Is this equivalent to using
    the vite plugin to create a single page?
  - what is the .lsp/config.edn file doing?
  - npx is no longer installed, so I can no longer run npx squint nrepl-server
    :port 1888
  - should I put this nrepl server command into package.json?
  - How does HMR work? Is its sole purpose to be able to reload with breaking
    the state of my app?
  - How does the plugin for vite prevent the need for a separate watch process?
  - I may want to ask about what my package.json should look like now such that
    I can run: npm dev.
  - what is the difference between npx and npm commands?
  - what is Cypress and Playwright? Testing?
  - Would you like me to show you how to structure your src/main.cljs so that it
    works perfectly with this Vite setup? (Specifically, how to export your init
    function so Vite can find it).
